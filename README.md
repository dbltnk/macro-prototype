## About this repository

This is the macro gameplay prototype for our upcoming Sandbox PvP game "Das Tal". It's a very rough and volatile in-progress draft of what we plan to make into the big otivational part of clan vs. clan conflict of the full game. Feel free to play the game, check out the source and give us feedback on it via <alexander.zacher@googlemail.com>.

## How to play the game

Just try it. But honestly it's too early. =D
